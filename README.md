# Model-Code Separation for Image Compression

This repository contains Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architectures that implement model-code separation for image compression purposes.  GANs are capable of learning strong generative priors over image datasets.  This can be leveraged to design aggressive image compression decoders that are independenent of the encoding architecture.
