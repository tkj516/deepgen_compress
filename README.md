# Model-Code Separation for Neural Image Compression

This repository contains a software implementation of model-code separation architectures for image compression using Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).  The motivation for such architectures stems from the inability of a GAN to readily trade-off between rate and distortion.  We show that an SRGAN can be easily used
for the decompression of dither-quantized 1bpp images.  However, it is difficult to succinctly quantify the level of perceptual distortion in the reconstruction due to the non-probablistic interpreation of the discriminator (i.e., the distortion function).  We instead focus our efforts on the lossless compression setting by leveraging a new class of deep probabilistic models
called Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) to model the statistical properties of source images.  A simple LDPC code, which is independent of the image structure, compresses the image into a bitstream and a novel SPN source-code belief propagation (BP) decoding algorithm can decode the images in under a fraction of a second.   In turn, we have a modular compression system with a lightweight encoder, model-adaptive decoder and a mechanism to run belief propagation in deep architectures for novel image compression.

**Note:** I am currently cleaning up the code for official release.  It will be cleaned up soon.
